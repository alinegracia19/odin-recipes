    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Indomie Nyemek is a popular Indonesian "upgrade" to standard instant noodles. The word nyemek refers to the texture—it’s not a soup, but it’s not dry either. It has a thick, rich, concentrated sauce that clings to the noodles.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 or 2 packs of Indomie Mi Goreng</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic (minced)</li>
        <li>Chilies (cabe rawit) as much you can handle</li>
        <li>1 or 2 eggs</li>
        <li>Sliced mustard greens (caisim), cabbage, or a few sliced meatballs (bakso).</li>
        <li>About 200–300ml (just enough to cover the noodles halfway).</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 1 tbsp of oil in a pan. Sauté the garlic, shallots, and chilies until they smell amazing.</li>
        <li>Add Protein: If you have bakso or sausage, toss them in now. Then crack one egg into the pan and scramble it roughly.</li>
        <li>Pour in the water and bring it to a boil.</li>
        <li>Add the Indomie noodles. Do not drain the water. Let the noodles soften in the boiling water.</li>
        <li>While the noodles are cooking, add the Indomie seasoning packets (oil, powder, and sauce) directly into the water. Add your extra Kecap Manis and Saus Sambal now too.</li>
        <li>If you want it extra rich, crack a second egg over the noodles when they are halfway done. Stir gently so the egg thickens the remaining water into a sauce.</li>
        <li>Add your greens (caisim or cabbage). Stir-fry for 1 more minute until the sauce has reduced and thickened but is still "wet."</li>
        <li>Top with the fried onions (bawang goreng) from the Indomie packet.</li>
    </ol>
