    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Indonesian fried rice, or Nasi Goreng, is famous for its dark, smoky, and caramelized flavor. The "secret" that makes it different from Chinese fried rice is Kecap Manis (Indonesian sweet soy sauce) and often a hint of shrimp paste.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups of rice</li>
        <li>2-3 tbsp Kecap Manis (Sweet Soy Sauce)</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic (minced)</li>
        <li>1 small shallot or onion (diced)</li>
        <li>1-2 red chilies (optional)</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp shrimp paste (Terasi) or 1 tsp fish sauce (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Fry the "Crown": Heat a little oil in a wok or large pan and fry one egg sunny-side up. Remove and set aside—this is the traditional topping.</li>
        <li>Sauté the Base: In the same pan, add a bit more oil. Sauté the garlic, shallots, and chilies until fragrant and slightly golden. If using shrimp paste, add it now and mash it into the oil.</li>
        <li>Scramble: Push the aromatics to the side, crack the second egg into the middle, and scramble it quickly.</li>
        <li>The Fry: Turn the heat to high. Add the cold rice. Toss it vigorously for 2 minutes so the grains are coated in oil and start to toast.</li>
        <li>The Caramelization: Pour the Kecap Manis over the rice. Stir-fry constantly for another 2-3 minutes. You want the sugar in the sauce to caramelize and turn the rice a deep, dark brown without burning it.</li>
        <li>Season: Add a pinch of salt and white pepper. Taste it—if you want it darker or sweeter, add a splash more Kecap Manis.</li>
    </ol>
